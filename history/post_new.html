<tr>
<td>1945</td>
<td>Konard Zuse developed Plankalkul, the first high level programming language</td>

<td>1952</td>
<td>Nathaniel Rochester and his group build IBM 701, this was the first computer to yield income for its manufacturer</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1956</td>
<td><li>The name artificial intelligence was coined by John McCarthy at Dartmouth College</li>
<li>Newell and Simon demonstrated their reasoning program called Logic Theorist (LT)</li>
<li>In February, Arthur Samuel demonstrated the program for playing checkers which could learn new moves on its own</li></td>
</tr>

<li>Bertram Raphael's SIR (Semantic Information Retrieval) was able to accept input statements in a very restricted subset of English and answer question thereon</li></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1997</td>
<td>Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world class champion, Garry Kasparov</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2011</td>
